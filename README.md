# Making a Pull Request (PR)

<pre><code>
Contributors will need to be able to make changes to the codebase. The steps to do this are
outlined below:

1. The first step to create a PR is to fork the repository so that GitHub is aware that
you have duplicated it. To do this, click the drop down at the top of the GitHub page that
says "Fork" and click "Create a new fork". GitHub will create a forked repository in under
you GitHub profile, thus you should not have to do this step again.

2. Nothing will change once you've forked the repository. Follow the command under the "Cloning"
section of this README above to clone the repository.

3. The next step is to create a local feature branch. 
Run <strong>git checkout -b &#9001;branch_name&#9002;</strong> to create a new branch called
<em>branch_name</em>.

4. Make changes. Do git <strong>add &#9001;files&#9002;</strong> to stage all files that you changed. Alternatively, you can
use <strong>git add *</strong>, but please do not do this carelessly.

5. Make a commit e.g. <strong>git commit -m "commit message".</strong>

6. Push the feature branch to GitHub e.g. <strong>git push -u origin &#9001;branch_name&#9002;</strong>

7. If successful, GitHub will immediately recognize the new branch. Now it is time to create the
PR. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab on GitHub under the main project page. Click
"New pull request". On the RIGHT-HAND side click on the drop down that says "compare: main", and
select your feature branch. Click Create pull request. Enter a PR description of why you are
making a PR and a brief of what changes were made. Click submit to have it be forwarded to the
project owner for review.
